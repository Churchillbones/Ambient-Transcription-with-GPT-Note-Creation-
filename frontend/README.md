# Angular Frontend

This folder contains the Angular UI for Ambient Scribe.

## Setup

1. Install Node.js and the Angular CLI.
2. Run `npm install` inside this directory to install dependencies.
3. Start the development server with `npm start`.

The app expects the backend FastAPI server to be running at `http://localhost:8000` and proxies API calls under `/api`.
