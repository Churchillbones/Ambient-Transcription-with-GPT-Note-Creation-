# Angular Frontend

This directory contains a minimal Angular project used to host the
medical transcription user interface.  The project does not include the
`node_modules` directory so you will need to install dependencies before
running the application.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16 or newer
- Angular CLI (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)

## Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
ng serve
```

This will start the Angular development server on `http://localhost:4200`.
